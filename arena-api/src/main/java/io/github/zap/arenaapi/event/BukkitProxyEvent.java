             you, Bukkit. why did you have to do this to me? don't you understand? it's not OKAY to iterate through
             every. single. listener that has ever been registered by every single plugin, every single time you want
             to remove a specific listener. USE A HASHMAP FOR THE LOVE OF NOTCH. oh, and it also enters a monitor on
             the arraylist used to store handlers. so it's probably going to block not ONLY the main thread, but ALSO
             potentially some async tasks too. great job! :D :D :D
